# Price-Optimisation-Modelling
## Overview
An internship project at Vistex focused on leveraging data science techniques to analyse and infer market trends for optimal list price adjustments. This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook demonstrating methodologies for predictive modelling and price optimisation.

## What the Project Does
The core of this project is to enhance the performance of predictive models used in pricing strategies. By analyzing market trends and their impact on list prices, the project aims to provide insights into:
* How market trends can be inferred from available data.

* The relationship between market trends and list price adjustments.

* The effectiveness of different modeling techniques in predicting price adjustments.

## Why the Project is Useful
This project serves as a valuable resource for:

* Data science students and professionals interested in real-world applications of market analysis and predictive modeling.

* Businesses looking to understand how data-driven insights can inform pricing strategies.

* Academics researching in the fields of economics, market trends, or data analysis.
